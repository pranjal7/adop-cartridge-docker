# What is a Cartridge?

A Cartridge is a set of resources that are loaded into the Platform for a particular project. They may contain anything from a simple reference implementation for a technology to a set of best practice examples for building, deploying, and managing a technology stack that can be used by a project.

This cartridge consists of source code repositories and jenkins jobs for a sample docker CI pipeline.

## Source code repositories

Cartridge loads the source code repositories

* [Tomcat8 Dockerfile](https://github.com/Accenture/adop-cartridge-docker-reference/)

## Jenkins Jobs

This cartridge generates the jenkins jobs and pipeline views to -

* Performs static code analysis using Dockerlint on the Dockerfile in the Git repository.
* Builds the Dockerfile in the repository.
* Performs a vulnerability scan on the built image using Clair [TO-DO]
* Image testing by analysing the outputs from docker inspect against a known configuration file.
* Container testing by creating a new testing image internally.
* Pushes the built and scanned image to a registry.
* Pull the built image from the registry and deploy it as a container.
* Manual step allowing you to clean up the deployed containers.

**Note** : The credential parameter used in the jenkins job expects the docker hub credentials to be added to jenkins with ID **docker-credentials**.
